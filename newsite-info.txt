The Ultimate Guide to Behind-the-Meter Energy Independence for C&I Businesses
By Alchemy, Your Partner in Power Solutions
In an era of grid instability and rising energy costs, behind-the-meter (BTM) energy storage offers C&I businesses a path to independence. This guide draws on key insights from Alchemy's expertise to help you achieve reliable, cost-effective power.
Why BTM Energy Independence Matters
Grid challenges like outages, voltage fluctuations, and demand charges disrupt operations and add costs. BTM batteries provide local control, instant response, and scalability, enabling energy independence without relying on the grid.
The Fundamental Power of Batteries
Batteries are a versatile powerhouse for C&I applications:
    • Versatile Powerhouse: Multitask peak shaving, backups, and renewables integration.
    • Local Energy Control: Manage power on-site, reducing waste and enhancing resilience.
    • Instant Response: Smooth spikes and dips for stable operations.
    • Flexible and Scalable: Adapt to any size, from small facilities to large grids.
    • Rapid Setup: Quick deployment for immediate value.
These benefits cut costs, improve reliability, and adapt to modern demands.
Steps to Energy Independence
    1. Assess Your Load: Use tools like Fluke Logger for harmonics and event recording.
    2. Identify Savings: Calculate peaks, sags, and arbitrage opportunities.
    3. Design BTM System: Tailor batteries for independence.
    4. Implement and Scale: Start with pilots for ROI validation.
Alchemy's Role

C&I Power Audit Checklist: Identify Peaks and Savings Opportunities
By Alchemy, Experts in Energy Optimization
Use this checklist to self-assess your facility's power issues, inspired by our Fluke Logger process. Spot opportunities for savings and energy independence.
Step 1: Hook Up Measuring Device
    • Connect to feeders or service entrance.
    • Secure the area to prevent tampering.
Step 2: Set Power System Parameters
    • Configure topology to match your system.
    • Verify line frequency and nominal voltage.
Step 3: Set Recording Time
    • Record 15-minute averages over 30 days (2,800 measurements).
Step 4: Record the Data
    • Track power (Watts), reactive power (vars), apparent power (VA), power factor, and energy (kWh).
    • Note peaks, sags, swells, and harmonics.
Step 5: Download and Review
    • Graph data to find max current/power per phase.
    • Calculate savings: Demand reduction ($4K–$10K/year), arbitrage ($2K–$5K/year), quality improvements ($10K/year).

The Hidden Costs of Power Outages: VoLL Insights for ERCOT C&I Businesses
By Alchemy, Experts in Energy Storage Solutions
Power outages in ERCOT can cost C&I businesses thousands per MWh. This guide summarizes a recent Brattle Group study on Value of Lost Load (VoLL), highlighting risks and how energy storage mitigates them.
Key Findings from the VoLL Study
    • ERCOT-Wide VoLL: ~$35,000 per unserved MWh for a 1-hour outage, higher than previous estimates.
    • C&I VoLL Estimates:
        ◦ Small C&I: $666,907/MWh (1-hour) due to low usage and high per-event costs.
        ◦ Medium/Large C&I: $22,721/MWh (1-hour), driven by lost revenue.
    • Outage Costs: Increase non-linearly with duration; advance warning reduces costs by 35%+ for small C&I.
    • Methodology: Customer surveys (2,991 residential, 1,711 C&I) and econometric models, weighted for ERCOT population.
    • Implications: High VoLL for C&I justifies investments in reliability to avoid $1,000–$5,000 per event losses.
How Energy Storage Reduces VoLL Risks
Alchemy's 48V ESS minimizes outage impacts:
    • Resilience: Provides backup, reducing VoLL by ensuring uptime.
    • Power Quality: Mitigates sags/swells, saving $10,000/year in damage.
    • Demand Reduction: Shifts peaks, saving $4,000–$10,000/year.
    • Total Savings: Up to $53,450/year, with 2.1-year payback.
